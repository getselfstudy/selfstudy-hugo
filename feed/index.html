American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-powered learning platform designed for the healthcare community delivers innovative continuous assessment solution for medical boards</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; <b>June 1, 2020</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8211; </span><a href="http://www.selfstudy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy Inc.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the leading precision learning software company, today announced its selection as the longitudinal assessment platform for the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery (ABFAS). A pioneer in continuous assessment and precision learning since 2015, SelfStudy will deliver ABFAS diplomates a user experience distinguished by ease of use, elegance, and extensive tools for enhanced tem review, while providing ABFAS administrators powerful real-time assessment analytics and statistics to support ongoing pram development. These are among the features that lead ABAFS to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">select SelfStudy’s platform to replace the current once-every-ten year maintenance of certification exams, and self assessments required of those certified in foot surgery and ankle surgery to remain certified.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We first deployed SelfStudy for longitudinal assessment in anesthesiology resident programs leading to certification” said SelfStudy CEO Brenda McLaughlin. “It worked so well, it is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for boards moving to longitudinal assessment for recertification. We are proud to be working with the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery, and look forward to meeting their rigorous assessment needs, applying the power of our AI platform to their unique body of knowledge to deliver a convenient, effective assessment solution to their diplomates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re excited to engage with SelfStudy to launch our longitudinal assessment program,” commented ABFAS Executive Director Katherine Kreiter. “ After a thorough review of longitudinal assessment platforms, we are confident we’ve made the best choice. The movement in medical specialties from periodic summative examination to longitudinal assessment has been growing for several years. Having determined that the time had come for us to adopt longitudinal assessment, we knew we needed a solution that would provide the best available experience for our diplomates, and the best backend analytic capabilities for us. And we found it in SelfStudy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy delivers a state-of-the-art longitudinal assessment solution, using responsive design for accessibility on any connected device:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Proven experience &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2015, SelfStudy has been supporting longitudinal assessment&nbsp;longer than other platforms subsequently launched by medical boards or third party providers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Fully featured</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Organizations can choose timed or untimed questions, standard or personalized, with confidence and relevance factors, explanations and references, AI-driven spaced repetition, cloned questions to validate learning, and more.</span></li>
<li><b>Algorithm independent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Platform can accommodate any preferred measurement, alone or in combination, including Measurement Decision Theory and proprietary algorithms developed at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research.</span></li>
<li><b>Powerful analytics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; See at a glance how diplomates are performing, and how well items are performing, allowing adjustments to be made at any time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
The SelfStudy platform has been successfully implemented in medical education and assessment programs by top hospitals, and associations, as well as by boards. SelfStudy’s ability to personalize delivery of content and generate learning activities from existing content assets makes a unique solution for bridging education and assessment.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New module lets instructors develop education or training courses in minutes</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><b>September 5, 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.selfstudy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy Inc.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the learning optimization technology company, today introduced CourseBuilder, a new module for the SelfStudy cloud platform that enables instant, automated creation of adaptive learning programs, including any professional education, training or test preparation. CourseBuilder leverages SelfStudy’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to allow anyone to rapidly build highly effective, personalized learning experiences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our economy continues to become more knowledge-based, organizations increasingly require effective programs for self-directed education or training to grow the knowledge and skill sets of their professional workforces. According to Training Industry, the professional training market is valued at $360 billion annually. Traditional and even recently introduced digital learning systems, in contrast, commonly require weeks or even months of development time to create courses, as well as the costly engagement of highly specialized consultants or technical resources to implement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With SelfStudy360, we introduced a more personalized and effective way for organizations to deliver their content and learning programs,” said SelfStudy CEO Brenda McLaughlin. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with CourseBuilder, the publishing of such content and learning programs online is entirely within the easy control of the organization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SelfStudy platform uses AI to put each learner on their best path to mastery of mission-critical information. Similar to GPS navigation, SelfStudy dynamically adjusts based on individual and community interactions to bridge personal knowledge gaps on a guided path to ongoing professional excellence. SelfStudy CourseBuilder adds the ability to automatically and instantly develop effective adaptive learning programs for self-directed education, formal courses or unit-based instruction, practical training or exams for learners to take wherever they are, whenever they’re ready, on any connected device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy CourseBuilder gives instructors the ability to build complete adaptive learning courses including educational or professional training programs which use AI to structure a learn-and-assess process that puts the learner in charge of the speed and options of their personalized learning journey. Once licensees migrate their content to the SelfStudy360 platform, CourseBuilder guides instructors through the automated course building process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the instructor adds the content they want to teach, from articles and research reports to videos, webinars and more. After selecting the material the instructor clicks a “Generate Course” button and CourseBuilder automatically builds question sets for the selected content. Finally, the tool completes the course and gives the instructor the ability to choose students to invite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A GPS for Learning, SelfStudy ensures that users are on the optimal path at all times to build understanding, earn credit, or attain certification. The platform blends machine learning and dynamic item response theory algorithms developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to assess each user and their community and in real time select the most relevant multimedia content to enable rapid mastery and retention of new knowledge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy will preview CourseBuilder for the first time at TechCrunch </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in San Francisco on September 5, 2018.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Optimization Technology Company Closes $3 Million Seed Round</span></i></p>
<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><b>May 30, 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><a href="http://www.selfstudy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy Inc.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a learning optimization technology company, today announced it is opening for licensing the first AI-powered cloud platform for professional societies and scholarly publishers to help them reduce costs and increase speed-to-market of individualized content discovery, and learning and training programs including certification and test preparation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also announced it closed a $3 million seed round of financing this month led by the </span><a href="http://www.iars.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Anesthesiology Research Society (IARS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to bring SelfStudy’s innovative platform to market and fund development of additional enhancements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called SelfStudy360, the new platform blends machine learning and dynamic item response theory algorithms developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to assess each user and their community, and in real-time select the most relevant multimedia content to enable rapid mastery and retention of new knowledge. Similar to GPS navigation software, the platform ensures that users are on the optimal path at all times to build knowledge, earn credit or attain certification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional education and certification is a huge market with very distinct needs. Scientific and technical publishing is a $9.9 billion industry, according to Simba Information, an authority for market intelligence and forecasts in the media and publishing industry. That market overlaps with CME, worth $2.5 billion annually, says the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, and additive to the professional training market, which Training Industry values at $360 billion annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built SelfStudy360 to transform the way organizations deliver their content and formal learning programs,” said SelfStudy CEO Brenda McLaughlin. “Our mission is to accelerate the mastery of new knowledge through personalized learning. To achieve that goal we use proven education methodologies and the most advanced technology available so professionals can always have the knowledge they need to be the best at what they do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy built the SelfStudy360 platform on the belief that all learning begins with discovery: the process of following interests, and then seeking more information about those interests. By applying artificial intelligence, the platform enables real-time content matching and presentation to support a range of learning approaches, from self-directed learning, formal courses or unit-based instruction, to traditional practical training programs. And the system’s continuous assessment functions ensure learners are consistently challenged and engaged, while also tracking performance for course credits or certification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SelfStudy360 platform’s capabilities include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Personalized Discovery</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Enhances learners’ ability to pursue their interests, and based on their most recent activity, as well as that of similar learners and the community, the platform presents new content that’s in line with those interests, what they still need to learn, as well as the wider interests of the community. The platform makes real-time decisions on the appropriate content for a particular learner and dynamically offers new directions for where they may want to go next.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Personalized Learning</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Allows users to take control and manage their own learning. In real-time and on a continuous basis, the platform accurately assesses knowledge against any standard, professional or individually established and delivers the learning activities to take each learner on the most efficient path to proficiency against that standard, similar to GPS navigation. SelfStudy360 also offers tools to aid teachers in assisting learners.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Continuous Assessment</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Delivers interactions that interest and engage learners while supporting longer-term goals through real-time tracking of progress and performance. Learners and their teachers always know where they are and can make adjustments to optimize learning. Continuous assessment enables competency-based training, badging and certification programs, low- to high-stakes remote testing at much lower cost as well as the ability for learners to proactively manage their own education.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personalized discovery powered by SelfStudy360 amplifies the efforts of curators and teachers in the learning process,” said Cart Reed, SelfStudy’s CTO. “And the addition of artificial intelligence only accelerates the discovery and mastery of new knowledge in any context.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform’s features include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Mentor/Program Director Support</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Offers analytics, reporting and communication tools supporting all forms of teacher interaction from explicit assignments and testing to ad-hoc support based on the platform’s tracking of individual and group learning progress, engagement and performance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Available on Any Device, Anytime, Anywhere</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Designed for use on phones, tablets, and laptops both for short periods and sustained learning sessions.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Simple Publishing Tools</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Supports auto-migration or syncing of large content databases and a wide range of file types as well as automated lesson and interaction generators.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Bolt-on or Integrated Solution</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Implement SelfStudy360 as a bolt-on to your existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or deploy it as a completely integrated solution. While the platform has all the tools and components needed for many enterprise users, SelfStudy360 can easily interoperate with existing learning management systems (LMS) and content delivery networks (CDNs) as it leverages open Internet standards.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IARS, which initiated development of SelfStudy360 and led the seed funding round, is now using the platform to deliver personalized IARS content and adaptive continuing medical education (CME) programs to its members. It will also use it to power the </span><a href="http://www.openanesthesia.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAnesthesia.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website, a comprehensive resource for anesthesiology residents and physicians worldwide, as well as its question-based mobile application supporting resident and physician education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s economy requires efficient, effective tools for self-directed education and building knowledge or skill sets,” said Tom Cooper, executive director of the IARS.  “Lots of platforms claim to be adaptive and personalized. If it were true, we wouldn’t have had to create SelfStudy360 to deliver on the promise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SelfStudy360 platform is now available for licensing.  Prices start as low as $25 per user annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy will demonstrate its new platform at the </span><a href="http://customer.sspnet.org/ssp/2018-Meeting/Event-Home/ssp/AM18/Home.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Society for Scholarly Publishing Annual Meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Chicago, today through June 1st.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Learning Optimization Technology Accelerates Mastery of New Knowledge</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> &#8211; <strong>April 26, 2018</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://www.selfstudy.com/">SelfStudy Inc.</a>, a new learning optimization technology company, today announced it will preview on Saturday the first implementation of its AI-powered cloud platform for delivering personalized content discovery and adaptive learning programs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform, designed for professional societies and publishers, blends machine learning and dynamic item response theory algorithms developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to assess each user and their community, and in real-time select the most relevant multimedia content to enable rapid mastery and retention of new knowledge.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SelfStudy360 platform includes simple back-end tools that automate content-creation, migration, and management; generate user analytics; handle credit administration and reporting, and facilitate badging and certification.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy360 will be demonstrated publicly for the first time at the <a href="http://www.iars.org/education/annual_meeting/">International Anesthesiology Research Society (IARS) 2018 Annual Meeting and International Science Symposium</a> in Chicago.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The IARS, which funded the development of SelfStudy360, intends to use the platform to deliver personalized IARS content and adaptive continuing medical education (CME) programs to its members. It will also use it to power the <a href="http://www.openanesthesia.org/">OpenAnest</a><a href="http://www.openanesthesia.org/">hesia</a><a href="http://www.openanesthesia.org/">.org</a> website, a comprehensive resource for anesthesiology residents and physicians worldwide, and its test preparation application.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Professionals should have the absolute best technology to manage their ongoing education while performing demanding jobs,” said SelfStudy CEO Brenda McLaughlin. “They have limited time, want to feel certain they’re doing the right thing and continually improve what they do. The new SelfStudy360 platform is built on proven education methodologies for accelerating mastery of any rapidly evolving body of knowledge.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Professional education and certification is a huge market with very distinct needs. Scientific and technical publishing is a $9.9 billion industry, according to Simba Information, an authority for market intelligence and forecasts in the media and publishing industry. That market overlaps with CME, worth $2.5 billion annually, says the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, and additive to the overall professional training market, which Training Industry values at $360 billion annually.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Most professionals don’t get classroom time – they have to squeeze in study sessions between work and family – so content must target their individual needs and weaknesses,” said McLaughlin.  “SelfStudy is fulfilling the vision that Massive Open Online Courses have only just begun to deliver on.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to GPS navigation software, SelfStudy360 uses machine learning to assess each learner’s knowledge to determine what data and information they need to achieve a goal – get from point A to point B. Then the system dynamically adjusts as content or the learner’s goal changes, or if a learner diverges from the original path created for them. SelfStudy360 also changes the learner’s path if many similar learners have success using a different path.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“SelfStudy360 can be used to curate and deliver any content, in any format – text, audio, or video – on any device,” said Thomas A. Cooper, executive director of the IARS, who commissioned the platform’s development. “But what I think is most impressive is the learning optimization technology developed by SelfStudy’s CTO, Cart Reed.  No other cloud platform can do what SelfStudy360 offers, or provides all of the back-end data and management tools so crucial to professional societies and their publishers.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy360 began as an internal IARS project to enhance its member services and improve CME programs. As it neared completion, it became clear the platform could be used by any professional society to increase the speed-to-market for personalized learning programs, including test preparation and certification.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SelfStudy will make its technology platform widely available soon. Additional details and pricing will follow.</p>
